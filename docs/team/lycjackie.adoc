== PROJECT: PlanWithEase

Hello there! I am Jackie. I am currently a student at the National University of Singapore +
(NUS) studying Information Security. I love to build application that could simplify our life then break it down to make
it better again!

This portfolio documents my involvement in the PlanWithEase, a degree planner
application which is morphed from https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4[AddressBook Level 4].

PlanWithEase is developed by my team (consisting of <<truegitnovice#,Ahn TaeGyu>>, <<wendybaiyunwei#,Bai YunWei>>, <<creastery#,Ngo Wei Lin>>,
 <<chyeo#, Yeo Cheng Hong>> and myself) under the CS2113T (Software Engineering & Object-Oriented Programming) module
taken in NUS over the span of 8 weeks.

== Overview

For this project, we aim to simplify the process of planning a degree, and ensure that the degree plan fulfills the
degree requirements for graduation.

With this goal in mind, we developed PlanWithEase (PWE), degree planner desktop application designed to help
National University of Singapore (NUS) Information Security freshmen in creating a comprehensive degree plan with ease
according to their degree requirements.

We understand that planning a degree is not an easy task,and can be very time-consuming. Further more there are much
considerations to make, making it confusing, troublesome and difficult to create the perfect degree plan.

With this goal in mind, we developed PlanWithEase (PWE), a degree planner application designed to help NUS
Information Security freshmen in creating a comprehensive degree plan according to the degree requirements effortlessly.

My role as a developer in this project involves designing and write code to enhance our existing `find` features
which enables our users to do the following:

* *Finding modules* with either its name, code or credits.
* *Complex search terms* to narrow down the find results.

== Understanding This Project Portfolio

The following symbols are used throughout this project portfolio:
[NOTE]
====
This symbol denotes information that you may want to take note of when using the application.
====
[TIP]
====
This symbol denotes a tip which you may find useful when using the application.
====
[WARNING]
====
This symbol denotes a warning message which you need to be careful of when using the application.
====

Additionally, you may also encounter the following text styles:
====
* Commands or parameters will be in this `format`.
* Important messages will be *bold*.
* Undoable command will be in _italics_.
* Keyboard buttons will be referred to as such: kbd:[F1].

== Summary of contributions

|===
|_This section details the main enhancements as well as other contributions I have made in the project._
|===

* *Main enhancement*: added *the ability to perform complex find command*
** What it does: allows the user to find modules via more complex find criteria. Find criteria can be composed from
mixed of logical AND (`&&`) and logical OR (`||`), users can optionally specify parenthesis to denote the expression
to be evaluated first.
** Justification: With a expected large number of modules available in our application, users needs to be able to
find a small subset of modules which are of interest to them. The ability of performing complex find commands give users
the flexibility of finding a smaller subset of modules which are relevant to them.
** Highlights: The algorithm for this enhancement was generalized not only to suit my own features, but also my team
mate's features. My team mate (<<truegitnovice#,Ahn TaeGyu>>) has managed to make use of this generalized class I created for his own
features. The implementation of this enhancement required some research on the different ways of parsing a boolean
expression, as there are many parsing algorithms available. After deciding on the algorithm to be used, I had to
implement the said algorithm in code using an Object-Orientated style, while trying to abstract the algorithm as much
 as possible as per the requirements of Object-Oriented Programming.
