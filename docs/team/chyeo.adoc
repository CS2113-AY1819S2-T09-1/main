== PROJECT: PlanWithEase
Greetings! I am *Yeo Cheng Hong*, a Year 2 student studying in the National University of Singapore (NUS). +
I have a burning passion for developing applications and software that have a positive impact on peoplesâ€™ life.

This portfolio serves as a documentation of my contributions and involvements of a team-based project that I recently
worked on for a module (CS2113T
Software Engineering & Object-Oriented Programming) here at NUS. +

This project was completed over the span of 8 weeks by me and 4 other amazing students (<<truegitnovice#,Ahn TaeGyu>>,
<<wendybaiyunwei#,Bai YunWei>>, <<lycjackie#,Lee Yu Choy>>, <<creastery#, Ngo Wei Lin>>).

I believe that this project is able to illustrate how I am able to turn my passion into a positive impact.

== Overview

PlanWithEase (PWE) is an application designed to help National University of Singapore (NUS) Information Security
freshmen in creating a comprehensive degree plan according to the degree requirements.

The main motivation behind PWE is to assist students by simplify the degree planning process, and at the same time
provide them with an overview of the degree plan so that they are able to make informed decisions.

== Summary of contributions

This section provides an overview of the contributions that I have made to this project

* *Major enhancement*: Degree Requirement Management
** This feature allows the user to manage the degree requirement categories in PlanWithEase easily using the
`requirement_add`, `requirement_remove` and `requirement_move` and `requirement_list` commands.

** Justification: This feature allows users to be able to keep track of the various different requirement categories.
 So that they are able to fulfill all the degree requirement categories in order to graduate on time.

** Highlights: This enhancement provides an overview of all the degree requirement categories by listing the modules
added to each degree requirement category as well as the current credit count of each degree requirement category.
