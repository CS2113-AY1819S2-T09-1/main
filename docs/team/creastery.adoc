== PROJECT: PlanWithEase

Hello there, I am _Wei Lin_. I am currently pursuing a degree in Information Security at National University of Singapore (NUS). +
I love to build and break applications!

This portfolio serves to document my involvements in a team-based project CS2113T (Software Engineering & Object-Oriented Programming) module by NUS.
The project spans over a period of eight weeks, and was completed by a team of five members (consisting of <<truegitnovice#,Ahn TaeGyu>>, <<wendybaiyunwei#,Bai YunWei>>, <<lycjackie#,Lee Yu Choy>>, <<chyeo#, Yeo Cheng Hong>> and myself) over the span of 8 weeks.

== Overview

In this project, our aim was to simplify the process of planning a degree, and ensure that the degree plan fulfills the
degree requirements.

Planning a degree is certainly not an easy task, and can be very time-consuming. Furthermore, there are many considerations to make, making it difficult to create the perfect degree plan.

With this goal in mind, we developed PlanWithEase (PWE), a degree planner application designed to help NUS
Information Security freshmen in creating a comprehensive degree plan according to the degree requirements effortlessly.

== Summary of Contributions

|===
|_This section provides a summary on the contributions I made to this project._
|===

=== *Major Enhancement*: Module Management

==== Add, Edit & Delete Modules

This feature allows the user to manage modules in PlanWithEase easily using the `add`, `edit` and `delete` commands.

** Justification: Users can keep track of module details (such as module co-requisites, the semesters the modules are offered in, etc.) within PlanWithEase to facilitate their planning.

** Highlights: This enhancement performs numerous validation checks to ensure that the degree plan created by the user remains sound after users edit module details, which is crucial in enabling the whole application to function correctly. The module management commands also provide tips on how to resolve any errors encountered by the users.

* Notable Enhancements/Modifications to Existing Features:
** Collaborated with a team mate (<<lycjackie#,Lee Yu Choy>>) to implement a *custom string tokenizer* `BooleanExpressionTokenizer`, which was pivotal in enabling users to be able to use complex search conditions to narrow down their search when using the `find` and `planner_show` commands (PR link:{prURL}/119[#119])

** Performed surgical *refactoring* of the original https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4[Address Book (Level 4)] codebase to fit our requirements (example: PRs link:{prURL}/18[#18], link:{prURL}/27[#27], link:{prURL}/30[#30])
** Populated *sample data* used to guide new users in using the application (examples: PRs link:{prURL}/45[#45], link:{prURL}/146[#146])
** Implemented *precondition checks* to all functional code to follow defensive programming practices (example: PR link:{prURL}/170[#170])

* Documentation:
** Performed *cosmetic tweaks* to existing contents of the User Guide: (examples: PRs link:{prURL}/147[#147], link:{prURL}/218[#218])
