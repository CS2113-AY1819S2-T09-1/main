== PROJECT: PlanWithEase

Hi! I am  Ahn Tae Gyu, an Information Security student in National University of Singapore. I am keen on writing
programs that help to improve qualities of our lives. You will be able to find brief introduction of the project
along with some of my contributions to the project below.

== Overview

PlanWithEase (PWE) is a degree planner desktop application designed to help National University of Singapore (NUS)
Information Security freshmen in creating a comprehensive degree plan according to the degree requirements. PWE is
designed to be simple and intuitive application that allows users to interact with by typing the commands
(using a Command Line Interface). Moreover, PWE also comes with a clean Graphical User Interface (GUI) that presents
information in an organized manner.Hence, even if you are unfamiliar with the Command Line Interface, you will  not
need to spend much time understanding how to use PWE. PWE was completed by a team of five members consisting of
<<creastery#,Ngo Wei Lin>>, <<wendybaiyunwei#,Bai YunWei>>, <<lycjackie#,Lee Yu Choy>>, <<chyeo#, Yeo Cheng Hong>>
and me.

== Summary of contributions
|===
|_Given below is a summary of contributions I made in this project._
|===

=== *Major Enhancement*: Degree Plan Management

==== Planner Move, Planner Show & Planner list

During this enhancement, *Degree Planner* model was build to allow other developer <<wendybaiyunwei#,Bai YunWei>> and me
to integrate planner related features into the application as well as stores degree plan related information.

* Summary of the features:
** Planner Move feature allows a module in the degree plan to be easily moved to another semester.
** Planner Show feature allows displaying of specific semesters.
** Planner list feature allows displaying of all semesters in the degree plan.

* Justification:
** Users can keep track of degree plan details (such as modules to take in particular semesters).
** Users can easily make changes to the degree plan by moving a module in the degree plan with `planner_move` command.
** Users can easily display specific semesters that the user wants with `planner_show` command.

* Highlights:
** During the enhancement, there were numerous reviews done to ensure that no other model components is
broken and any degree plan related features can be integrated without any problem.
* Planner Move was enhanced to carried out checks for the module's co-requisite and semesters it and its
co-requisites are offered in.
* Planner Show was enhanced to utilize boolean expression parser that was designed by <<lycjackie#,Lee Yu Choy>>.

* Credits:
** Plenty of module corrections and suggestions were made during the built of  *Degree Planner* model by <<creastery#,
Ngo Wei Lin>>.
** Boolean expression parser was designed by <<lycjackie#,Lee Yu Choy>>.

=== *Minor Enhancement*: Adding UI segment for degree plan
* Justification: UI part for degree plan was added to displays the semesters and modules to be taken during the
semesters.
* Highlights:
** Browser Panel that existed originally have to be adjusted in order for the UI part of the degree
plan to be added.
** UI for Degree plan was updated to sort the degree plan before displaying.
* Credits:
** Beautification of the overall UI including the part for the degree plan was done by <<lycjackie#,Lee Yu
Choy>>
