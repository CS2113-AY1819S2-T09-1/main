== PROJECT: PlanWithEase

Hi! I am  Ahn Tae Gyu, an Information Security student in National University of Singapore. I am keen on writing
programs that help to improve qualities of our lives. You will be able to find brief introduction of the project
along with some of my contributions to the project below.

== Overview

PlanWithEase (PWE) is a degree planner desktop application designed to help National University of Singapore (NUS)
Information Security freshmen in creating a comprehensive degree plan according to the degree requirements. PWE is
designed to be simple and intuitive application that allows users to interact with by typing the commands
(using a Command Line Interface). Moreover, PWE also comes with a clean Graphical User Interface (GUI) that presents
information in an organized manner.Hence, even if you are unfamiliar with the Command Line Interface, you will  not
need to spend much time understanding how to use PWE. PWE is build by me and 4 other Information Security students.
