By: `Team T09-1`      Since: `Feb 2019`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`*
+
[NOTE]
Only JDK 9 is officially supported
. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/pwe/planner/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/pwe/planner/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `pwe.planner.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/pwe/planner/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible
for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::SDforDeleteModule.png[width="800"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/pwe/planner/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ModuleListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/pwe/planner/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in
link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/pwe/planner/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `ApplicationParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a module).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteModuleSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/pwe/planner/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Application data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Module>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageComponentDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/pwe/planner/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Application data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `pwe.planner.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo Feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedApplication`.
It extends `application` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `applicationStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedApplication#commit()` -- Saves the current application state in its history.
* `VersionedApplication#undo()` -- Restores the previous application state from its history.
* `VersionedApplication#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone application state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitApplication()`, `Model#undoApplication()` and
`Model#redoApplication()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedApplication` will be initialized with the
 initial application state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single application state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th module in the application. The `delete` command calls
 `Model#commitApplication()`, causing the modified state of the application after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `applicationStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted application state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new module. The `add` command also calls
`Model#commitApplication()`, causing another modified application state to be saved into the `applicationStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitApplication()`, so the application state will not be
 saved into the `applicationStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the module was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the
`undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoApplication()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous application state, and restores the application to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial application state, then there are no previous
application states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoApplication()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoApplication()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer`
once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the application to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `applicationStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest application
state, then there are no undone application states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoapplication()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the application, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitapplication()`, `Model#undoapplication()` or `Model#redoapplication()`. Thus, the `applicationStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitApplication()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not
pointing at the end of the `applicationStateList`, all application states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire application.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the module being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of application states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both
`HistoryManager` and `VersionedApplication`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::editing_module[]
=== Edit Module Feature
The `edit` feature aims to help users update module details in our application. When there are changes to be made to
the module (e.g. semesters which modules are offered in have changed), users will want to be able to update the
module details easily without going through the hassle of deleting and adding the new module.

This section describes the implementation and the design considerations of the `edit` feature, and how the `edit`
feature is capable of cascading the updated module code from the module list to the requirement categories and degree
 plan.

==== Current Implementation
When the user invokes the `edit` command, e.g. (`edit 1 code/CS1231`), the following steps are taken by the
application.

. The `CommandParser` invokes the `EditCommandParser` class to parse the user input provided. The parsed data will
then be used to create a `EditCommand` object and will be returned to `CommandParser` and subsequently `LogicManager`.

. `LogicManager` would then invoke the `EditCommand#execute(...)`, which performs the following validation checks to ensure that the edited module details are valid.
* Ensures that the edited module does not exists in module list (non-duplicate module) +
* Ensures that the edited module is not updated to be a co-requisite of itself (no self-referencing) +
* Ensures that the edited module's co-requisite exists in the module list +
* Ensures that the edited module's co-requisites can be taken in the same semester +
* Ensures that the edited module can be taken in the same semester as the edited module's co-requisites +
* Ensures that the updated semesters which the edited module is offered in allows the module to remain in the current semester of the degree plan.

. Once the validation checks are complete, `EditCommand` will invoke `Model#editModule(...)`, which will be
discussed later.

. `EditCommand` will then invoke `Model#updateFilteredModuleList(...)` to display all modules in the filtered module list.

. Finally, a success message will be displayed to the user.

The high-level overview sequence diagram for the `edit` feature is shown below.

[NOTE]
====
`errorChecks(...)` does not actually exists in `EditCommand`. +
It is used below as a representation of all the validation checks (discussed above) present in `EditCommand.execute(...)`.

ifndef::env-github[]
image::SD_Edit_Overview.png[width="970"]
endif::[]

If there are any changes made to the module's code, `Model#editModule(...)` will cascade the edited module code to the rest of the Model objects (namely `UniqueModuleList`, `UniqueDegreePlannerList`, `UniqueRequirementCategoryList`) through `Application`.

. When `Model#editModule(...)` is invoked, `Application#editModule(...)` will be called.
. `Application#setModule(...)` is invoked to replace the original module with the edited module in `UniqueModuleList`.
. When setting the edited module in `UniqueModuleList`, `UniqueModuleList` will cascade the edited module code to all modules' co-requisites
. The edited module code is cascaded to `UniqueDegreePlanner` as `Application#setModule(...)` checks if the original module code exists in the degree planner, and if so, updates it accordingly.
. Similarly, `Application#setModule(...)` also checks if the original module code exists in the requirement categories, and if so, updates it accordingly.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How should edited module code be cascaded down to other Model objects?

The table below shows comparisons between the two approaches.

[cols="30%,35%,35%"]
|=====
|*Approach* | *Pros* | *Cons*|
*1.* Implement cascading of edited module code in `EditCommand` |
It makes sense for a class in Logic component to handle logic-related matters.
a|
* It creates coupling between `EditCommand` and the various Model objects (i.e. `UniqueModuleList`,
`UniqueDegreePlannerList` and `UniqueRequirementCategoryList`.|
 *2.* Implement cascading of edited module code in `Application`
 |It doesn't create additional coupling with other Model components
a|
* Implementing logic (cascading effect) in `Application` (a class in Model component) may contradict Separation of Concerns Principle.
|=====

After weighing the pros and cons, *approach 2* was chosen. +

Firstly, doing so will reduce the need for additional coupling with other Model components (as compared to approach
1). Although it may seem strange to implement logic checks to achieve the desired cascading effect of the edited module
code in `Application` (a class in the Model component), implementing logic checks in Model can also be seen as a way
of maintaining data integrity. One such example is Java's `Set` interface (Model), where each implementing class
ensures that there are no duplicate elements in the collection of data (i.e. implementing logic in model).

Similarly, implementing cascading of edited module code in `Application` is deemed to be similar to implement logic
in model for maintaining data integrity. As such, *approach 2* is more suitable and was chosen.
// end::editing_module[]

// tag::corequisites[]
=== Module co-requisites
==== Current Implementation

Module co-requisites are stored internally as `Set<Code>` within `Module`.

A `Set<Code>` is used instead of a `List<Code>` to ensure uniqueness and prevents duplicate co-requisites module codes.

Notice that `Code` is used in place of `Module`. This is to prevent storage of duplicated information when serializing `UniqueModuleList`.

`AddCommand` handles invalid cases by preventing adding a co-requisite module code that does not exists in the module list. +
`EditCommand` handles invalid cases by ensuring that:

* the edited co-requisite module code is not equivalent to the `Code` of the edited module +
* the edited co-requisite module `Code` exists in the module listing

When a module is deleted, it is cascaded down to other modules, and is removed from other modules' co-requisites.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How should deletion of a module be cascaded down to other modules

The table below shows comparisons between the two approaches.

[cols="30%,35%,35%"]
|=====
|*Approach* | *Pros* | *Cons*|
*1.* Delete module code from other modules' corequisites in `Application` class |
Implementing the cascading effect in `Application#removeModule()` protects data
a|
* Requires extra overhead to obtain an immutable list of modules to update and modify existing modules in the `UniqueModuleList` +
* `Application` class needs to handle logic checks to ensure data interity
 |*2.* Delete module code from other modules' corequisites in `DeleteCommand` class
 |Convenient to implement.
a|
* Deleting a module via `Application#removeModule()` does not have any cascading effect on other modules'
  corequisites. The user will have to delete the invalid co-requisite manually afterwards.
|=====

After weighing the pros and cons, *approach 1* was chosen. +
As we are expecting many similar names between modules in the university curriculum, if the user could only search
with an implicit logical `OR`, the user would not be able to find the desired modules effectively. This can drastically
 reduce the effectiveness of the `find` command.

// end::corequisites[]

// tag::find[]
===  Find Feature

The `find` feature aims to help users to be able to easily locate any modules in our application. With a large number
of modules available to our users, `find` feature is essential. Currently, the `find` feature only supports searching
 of module's name, code, credits, tags and the semesters it is offered in.

This section shares the implementation and the design considerations gone through while enhancing the find feature.
Details on how the find feature is implemented and how it supports more search parameters are also shared.

==== Overview

When a user invokes the `find` command. (e.g. find name/Programming || code/CS1231), the following steps are taken by
the program.

1. Extract out the text related to `find` command
2. Parse the text related to each `PREFIX` individually.
3. Return a composite predicate for all attributes.

Step 1 is performed by the `ApplicationParser` class, and no special actions is needed for the `find` feature.

Step 2 and 3 are performed by `BooleanExpressionParser#parse`

The class diagram below shows the different components and constraints for `find` feature.

.Class diagram for `find` feature
ifdef::env-github[]
image::FindCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
endif::[]

ifndef::env-github[]
image::FindCommandClassDiagram.png[width="970"]
endif::[]


==== Current Implementation

The `FindCommandParser` parses the strings of arguments provided by the user to retrieve a composite `Predicate`
which is used by `FindCommand`. A `ParseException` is thrown in the case if the input provided by the user does not
conform to the expected format.

The sequence diagram below shows the interaction within the `Logic` components.

.Find component interactions
ifdef::env-github[]
image::FindCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
endif::[]

ifndef::env-github[]
image::FindCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="970"]
endif::[]


The main implementation of this feature is split into two components. The `Tokenizer` and `BooleanExpressionParser`

. `Tokenizer` helps to split the user provided argument into tokens which could be used by `BooleanExpressionParser`.
. `BooleanExpressionParser` simply performs Shunting-Yard algorithm on the boolean expression tokens provided by the
`Tokenizer`  and maps them into `Predicate` which could be used by `FindCommand`.

`FindCommandParser` calls `BooleanExpressionParser#parse` which handles the evaluation of the expression. +
This process is achieved by the code snippet shown below.

```java
String trimmedArgs = args.trim();
if (trimmedArgs.isEmpty()) {
    throw new ParseException(
            String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, FindCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
}
Predicate<Module> predicate = BooleanExpressionParser.parse(args, PREFIXES);
return new FindCommand(predicate);
```



To support more parameters for our `find` feature. You can do the following steps.

. Create a new `Predicate` class (e.g. `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`) and define your expected behaviour in it.
. Ensure your `Predicate` class extends `KeywordsPredicate`.
. Update `BooleanExpressionParser#getKeywordsPredicate` to handle the creation of the `Predicate`.
. Update `CliSyntax` on the new prefix you would like for the new parameter.
. Update `FindCommandParser` to take in the new `PREFIX`.

Your new parameter will now be supported after the above steps!

==== Tokenizer

This is represented by the class `pwe.planner.logic.parser.BooleanExpressionTokenizer` and is designed to extract
all argument with `PREFIX` and `OPERATOR` as a token.

This class is initialized with the input argument and prefixes and can be queried for token multiple times. +
Each query will consume the previous token and returns the next available token. +
This is similar to how `java.util.Scanner` works.

===== Design Consideration

After many rounds of experiment with `StringTokenizer` that is provided by native Java and `ArgumentMultimap`. +
We found three main issues which could not be satisfied by either `StringTokenizer` or `ArgumentMultimap`.

. `ArgumentMultimap` does not keep track of the order of each delimiter. They will only track if the delimiter exists.
. `StringTokenizer` has a default delimiter as a whitespace, although we could change the delimiter and parse multiple
delimiters. It does not suit our situation. +
e.g. `find name/AAAA code/BBBB`. +
This will return us 1 token. `name/AAAA code/BBBB`, which we cannot use to check due to the missing `operator`. +
We need the tokenizer to return us 2 tokens `name/AAAA` and `code/BBBB` in order for us to know that the expression
was invalid due to the missing `operator`.
. `StringTokenizer` can take in `PREFIX` as delimiter, however, this will split the argument (i.e. `code/CS1231`) into
two tokens, `code/` and `CS1231`. +
Additional parsing is required before we are able to pass it to `BooleanExpressionParser`. This parsing creates more
overhead as we have to ensure that the proper checks are done.

As such, our custom `Tokenizer` aims to solve these three issues.

The table below shows the differences among our `Tokenizer`, `StringTokenizer` and `ArgumentMultimap`
|====
| *`Tokenizer`* | *`StringTokenizer`* | *`ArgumentMultimap`*
| Respect the order of delimiters. | Respect the order of delimiters | Only keep track which delimiters are present.
| Support multiple delimiters. | Support multiple delimiters. | Support multiple delimiters.
| Splitting tokens is more flexible | Only split token based on delimiters | Does not split into token.
|====

==== Operator

This is represented by the class `pwe.planner.logic.parser.Operator` and defines all valid operators to be used in
`BooleanExpressionParser`.

The table below shows the valid operators that our application currently supports.

|====
| *Operator* | *Description* | *Precedence*
| `&&` | Logical "AND" operation (both conditions A AND B must match) | Highest
| `\|\|` | Logical "OR" operation (either conditions A OR B must match)| Lowest
| `(` and `)` | Search term surrounded by parenthesis will always be evaluated first. If there is a tie, the logical
operator precedence will be taken into consideration. | N.A
|====

To support more operators for our `BooleanExpressionParser`. The following steps should be performed.

. Add the operator and give it precedence.
. Update the mapping between `String` and `Operator` in `Operator#getOperatorFromString`
. Update the logic of the new operator in `Operator#applyOperator`
. Update `CliSyntax.OPERATORS` to include the new operator.

==== Boolean Expression Parser

This is represented by the class `pwe.planner.logic.parser.BooleanExpressionParser` and is designed to map user
provided input into composite `Predicate<Module>`.

The following table shows the operators currently supported by `BooleanExpressionParser`(Highest precedence
first).
|====
| *Operators* | *Description*
| `&&` | Logical AND of two predicates
| `\|\|` | Logical OR of two predicates.
|====

Parentheses `(` and `)` are also recognized and respected, and they may be nested to arbitrary depth. This is handled by
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm[Shunting Yard] algorithm which respects the precedence of each
 operators when parsing.

The sequence diagram below shows the interactions between `FindCommandParser` and `BooleanExpressionParser`.

endif::[]


When `FindCommandParser` receives the provided user argument, it will carry out checks and pass the argument to
 `BooleanExpressionParser` which will initialize a new `Tokenizer` that extracts the arguments as tokens. +
`BooleanExpressionParser` will create a `Predicate` based on the `Prefix` in each token. If the token is an `Operator`,
`BooleanExpressionParser` will apply the operator on two `Predicate` to combine them into a composite `Predicate`.

[TIP]
====
See <<Tokenizer>> for more details regarding the tokenizer.

The process of how the predicate for each prefix is created is shown in the code snippet below.

ArgumentMultimap argMultimap =

    String nameKeyword = ParserUtil.parseName(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_NAME).get()).toString();
    predicate = new NameContainsKeywordsPredicate(List.of(nameKeyword));
} else if (argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_CODE).isPresent()) {
    String codeKeyword = ParserUtil.parseCode(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_CODE).get()).toString();
    predicate = new CodeContainsKeywordsPredicate(List.of(codeKeyword));
} else if (argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_CREDITS).isPresent()) {
    String creditKeyword = ParserUtil.parseCredits(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_CREDITS).get()).toString();
    predicate = new CreditsContainsKeywordsPredicate(List.of(creditKeyword));
} else {
    throw new ParseException(
            String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, FindCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
}
return predicate;
```

==== Design Considerations

This section shares the design considerations we went through during the enhancing the existing `find` feature.

===== Aspect: Parsing of composite predicate
The table below shows comparisons between the two approaches.

[cols="30%,35%,35%"]
|=====
|*Approach* | *Pros* | *Cons*|
*1.* Implement an algorithm https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm[Shunting Yard] that parses the complex
boolean expression and returns a composite predicate. |
Find command can be very flexible. It can work with multiple parameters to search for the specific modules that the
user wants.
a|
* Requires many tests to ensure expected behaviours
* Extra work is required to integrate a new logic parser into `FindCommandParser`. It may result in  build problems if
 it is not implemented properly.
 |*2.* Do an implicit logical `OR` for every predicate.
 |Very easy to implement a|
* Returns a very huge set of results when the number of keywords increase.
* Find command will be restricted to logical `OR` results.
|=====

After weighing both pros and cons, we decided to go with *approach 1*. +
As we are expecting many similar names between modules in the university curriculum, if the user could only search
with an implicit logical `OR`, the user would not be able to find the desired modules effectively. This can drastically
 reduce the effectiveness of the `find` command.
//end::find[]

// tag::requirement-add[]
=== Requirement Add Feature
The requirement add feature in the application aims to help users to keep track and check if they have fulfilled a
particular degree requirement category by adding module code(s) to the specified requirement category.

==== Current implementation

When the user invokes the `requirement_add` command, e.g. (requirement_add name/Mathematics code/MA1531). +
The following steps are taken by the application.

*1.* The `CommandParser` invokes the `RequirementAddCommandParser` class to parse the user input provided.
 The parsed data will then be used to create a `RequirementAddCommand` object and will be returned to
 `LogicManager`.

[NOTE]
====
* The input should only consist of the `name` of the requirement category and module `code`(s) to be added
* `RequirementAddCommandParser` will throw an error if the user input does not match the command format
====

*2.* Upon receiving the `RequirementAddCommand` object, `LogicManager` would then invoke the `RequirementAddCommand`
 class to pass the object received.

Once invoked, `RequirementAddCommand` will perform the following checks on the object received: +
 * Check if the degree requirement category exists in the application through `getRequirementCategory` +
 * Check if the module codes provided exists in the application through `model.hasModuleCode` +
 * Check if the module codes have already been added to other degree requirement categories +
 * Check if the module codes have already been added to the specified degree requirement category through
   `RequirementCategory.hasModuleCode`

[NOTE]
====
`RequirementAddCommand` will throw an error if any of the above checks fails.
====

*3.* After passing all of the above checks, `RequirementAddCommand` updates the context in `Model` through
`setRequirementCategory`.

*4.* In addition to adding module code(s) to the specified degree requirement category, the `RequirementAddCommand`
class also saves the current database state through `commitApplication` (for undo/redo functions).

The sequence diagram below shows how this command interacts with the `Logic` components as described above.

==== Design Considerations

This section describes the various design considerations the taken when implementing the `requirement_add`
feature.

===== Aspect: Choice of what is stored in the requirement category storage file

The table below shows a comparison between the two approaches that could have been implemented.

[cols="30%,35%,35%"]
|=====
|*Approach* | *Pros* | *Cons*|
*1.* Storing only the module codes in the requirement category storage file
 a|
* Lesser storage space is required as only the module code is being stored
* Easy to maintain, as only one information is being stored
a|
* Extra overhead is required when additional information related to the module is retrieved
 |*2.* Storing all information related to the modules but only the module code is displayed
a|
* Any information related to the modules is easily retrievable
a|
* The module information is duplicated, additional storage space and processing time is needed to load the
 entire requirement category
* Hard to maintain and manage the stored information. If a module information is updated the information in the
 requirement category storage needs to be updated as well.
|=====

After evaluating the pros and cons of both approaches, we have decided to implement *Approach 1*.

The main reason is that all module information would be duplicated again in the requirement category storage file.
This would effectively make the module storage file redundant as the information can be found in the requirement
category storage file.

In addition, when a module information is updated, we have to ensure that the information in both storage files are
updated and consistent to avoid any conflicting information.

Another factor that heavily impacted the decision would be that each module is uniquely identified by a module code.
Hence, by storing the module code only, the module's information can be easily obtained.

//end::requirement-add[]

// tag::requirement-move[]
=== Requirement Move Feature
The requirement move feature in the application aims to help users to be able to move module code(s) from any degree
requirement category to the specified requirement category.

==== Current implementation

When the user invokes the `requirement_move` command, e.g. (requirement_move name/Mathematics code/CS1231). +
The following steps are taken by the application.

*1.* The `CommandParser` invokes the `RequirementMoveCommandParser` class to parse the user input provided.
 The parsed data will then be used to create a `RequirementMoveCommand` object. The `RequirementMoveCommand` object
 will then be returned to `LogicManager`.

[NOTE]
====
* The input should only consist of the `name` of the requirement category and module `code`(s) to be moved
* `RequirementMoveCommandParser` will throw an error if the user input does not match the command format
====

*2.* Upon receiving the `RequirementMoveCommand` object, `LogicManager` would then invoke the `RequirementMoveCommand`
 class to pass the object received. +

Once invoked, `RequirementMoveCommand` will perform the following checks on the
 object received: +
* Check if the degree requirement category specified exists in the application through `getRequirementCategory` +
* Check if the module code(s) provided exists in the application through `model.hasModuleCode` +
* Check if the module code(s) provided already been added to the degree requirement category +

[NOTE]
====
`RequirementMoveCommand` will throw an error if any of the above checks fails.
====

*3.* After passing all of the above checks, `RequirementMoveCommand` determines if the modules code(s) to be moved
belongs
 to a single degree requirement category or from multiple degree requirement categories

*4.* If the module code(s) belongs to a *single* degree requirement category, `RequirementMoveCommand` will move all the
 module code(s) specified at once. +
If the module code(s) belong to *multiple* degree requirement categories, `RequirementMoveCommand` will move the
module code(s) specified at one by one

*5.* In addition to adding module code(s) to the specified degree requirement category, the `RequirementMoveCommand`
class
also saves the current database state through `commitApplication` (for undo/redo functions).

The sequence diagram below shows how this command interacts with the `Logic` components as described above.

==== Design Considerations

This section describes the various design considerations the taken when implementing the `requirement_move`
feature.

===== Aspect: To include a check to determine if the module code(s) specified come froms a single source degree requirement category

The table below shows a comparison between the two approaches that could have been implemented.

[cols="30%,35%,35%"]
|=====
|*Approach* | *Pros* | *Cons*|
*1.* Implementing to check if the module code(s) comes from a single source
 a|
* Able to move all modules at once
* Reduce overhead
a|
* Extra checks are required in the application
 |*2.* Not implementing to check if the module code(s) comes from a single source
a|
* Lesser checks needs to be implemented
a|
* More overhead is needed when handling the moving of the module code(s)
|=====

After evaluating the pros and cons of both approaches, we have decided to implement *Approach 1*.

The main reason is that it has a slight performance boost for the application as all the module code(s) can be moved
together at once, reducing the overall overhead.

//end::requirement-move[]

// tag::requirement-list[]
=== Requirement List Feature
The requirement list feature in the application allow users to display all requirement categories and the module code(s)
 that have been added to the requirement categories.

==== Current implementation

The `requirement_list` command requires no additional input other than the command itself.
When the user executes the `requirement_list` command, the following steps are taken by the the application.

*1.* The `CommandParser` invokes the `RequirementListCommand` class

*2.* When the `RequirementListCommand` class is invoked, it will perform the following actions before displaying the
output to the user:

- Obtain a list of all the requirement categories and the modules added to each requirement category in the application
through `getFilteredRequirementCategoryList`
- Obtain the module credit information for every module added into each requirement category through `getModuleByCode`

*3.* Once the information has been populated, the application will then display all requirement categories, the current
 credit count for each requirement category as well as the module(s) added to each requirement category.

[NOTE]
====
If there are no modules added to a requirement category, the application will display `No modules in this category!`
 for that particular requirement category.
====

==== Design Considerations

This section describes the various design considerations the taken when implementing the `requirement_list`
feature.

===== Aspect: Tracking the current amount of credits in a requirement category

The table below shows a comparison between the two approaches that could have been implemented.

[cols="30%,35%,35%"]
|=====
|*Approach* | *Pros* | *Cons*|
*1.* Creating a dedicated attribute to track the current amount credits of a requirement category
 a|
* Current amount of credits is always available and easily obtainable
a|
* Hard to maintain. When a module credit is updated to a new value, the attribute has to be updated as well to
 prevent conflicting information.
 |*2.* Calculating the current amount of credits of a requirement category when needed
a|
* Any information related to the modules is easily retrievable as each module is uniquely identified by the module
code
* No extra maintenance of information needed
* Able to easily calculate the credits when needed as module information
  are easily obtainable.
a|
* Extra overhead is required to retrieve the module's information and compute the current amount of credits
|=====

After evaluating the pros and cons of both approaches, the group decided that *Approach 2* was to be implemented.

The determining factor was that the module's credits can be easily obtain. Hence the current amount of credits for a
particular requirement category can be easily calculated as and when needed.

Furthermore, when a module's credits is changed, we have to ensure that the information in the
requirement category storage file is updated as well. Which is hard to maintain as the requirement category
containing the module code must first be retrieved for the attribute to be updated.

//end::requirement-list[]

// tag::planner-add[]
=== Planner Add Feature
The `planner_add` command in PWE is used to add module code(s) to the degree plan.

==== Current implementation

The `planner_add` command requires the `PlannerAddCommandParser` class to parse the user input provided. The
 parsed data will then be passed to the `PlannerAddCommand` class.

The input should contain the year and semester of the degree plan as well as the module code(s) to be added.

`PlannerAddCommandParser` will throw an error if the user input does not match the command format.

When `PlannerAddCommand` receives the parsed data, it will perform the following checks:

- Check if the year and semester exist in the degree plan
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Check if the module codes provided exists in PWE through `model.hasModuleCode`
=======
- Check if the module codes provided exist in PWE through `model.hasModuleCode`
>>>>>>> 396d4219ed4b7746d7b1d08878015af4e297bc67
- Check if the module codes have already been added to the degree plan
- Check if the co-requisites of modules provided already exist in other semesters of the degree plan

`PlannerAddCommand` will throw an error if any of the above checks fails.

After passing all of the above checks, `PlannerAddCommand` updates the context in `ModelManager` through
`setDegreePlanner`.

In addition to adding module code(s) to the degree plan, the `PlannerAddCommand` class also saves the
current database state through `commitApplication` (for undo/redo functions).

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Choice of whether to deal with certain possible errors when the application gets modified.

- Alternative 1 (current choice): Checking for invalid co-requisites as well as non-existent year and semester in degree plan.

[cols="30%,<70%"]
|======
|*Pros*| Software is more secure against possible errors.
|*Cons*| Harder to maintain.
|======

- Alternative 2: Skipping checks for invalid co-requisites as well as non-existent year and semester in degree plan.

[cols="30%,<70%"]
|=====
|*Pros*| Easier to maintain.
|*Cons*| When certain parts of the software get modified, some errors may occur with this command. For instance, a user may use `EditCommand` to edit co-requisites. If the check was not in place and the edit command fails to add the edited co-requisites to the degree plan, the user will then be able to add the co-requisites to invalid semesters of the degree plan.

|=====
//end::planner-add[]

// tag::planner-remove[]
=== Planner Remove Feature
The `planner_remove` command in PWE is used to remove module code(s) from the degree plan.

==== Current implementation

The `planner_remove` command requires the `PlannerRemoveCommandParser` class to parse the user input provided. The
 parsed data will then be passed to the `PlannerRemoveCommand` class.

The input should contain the module code(s) to be removed.

`PlannerRemoveCommandParser` will throw an error if the user input does not match the command format.

When `PlannerRemoveCommand` receives the parsed data, it will perform the following checks:

- Check if the module codes to remove exist in the degree plan.

`PlannerRemoveCommand` will throw an error if any of the above checks fails.

After passing all of the above checks, `PlannerRemoveCommand` updates the context in `ModelManager` through
`setDegreePlanner`.

In addition to removing module code(s) from the degree plan, the `PlannerRemoveCommand` class also saves the
current database state through `commitApplication` (for undo/redo functions).

.PlannerRemoveCommand class diagram
image::PlannerRemoveCommandClassDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Choice of whether to use `getDegreePlannerByCode` method for removing module codes.

- Alternative 1 (current choice): Looping through all semesters of the degree plan instead of using `getDegreePlannerByCode` to identify the relevant semesters of the codes to remove.

[cols="30%,<70%"]
|======
|*Pros*| Simpler code.
|*Cons*| May loop through extra semesters when there are few module codes to remove.
|======

- Alternative 2: Using `getDegreePlannerByCode` method to identify the relevant semesters containing the code to remove. Removing the codes in the selected semester only.

[cols="30%,<70%"]
|=====
|*Pros*| When there are few module codes to remove, the method may incur in slightly less overhead.
<<<<<<< HEAD
|*Cons*| When there are N modules to remove, while the current method only needs 16 (total number of semesters) outer loops, this alternative method needs N outer loops. Moreover, `getDegreePlannerByCode` method itself also needs to loop through the DegreePlanner List to find out the part with suitable semester. The time comlexity for both methods can be the same.

//end::planner-remove[]

// tag::planner-move[]
=== Planner Move Feature

The `planner_move` command aims to provide functionality for users to move a module between academic semesters in the
degree plan along with its co-requisites.

This section shares the implementation and design considerations made during the enhancement of the `planner_move`
feature.

==== Overview

As the users often encounter situations where they decide to take the modules in other semesters after they have
completed their degree planning, the `planner_move` feature is essential to have.

Current `planner_move` feature supports the moving of a module along with its co-requisites given the module and
its co-requisites are offered in the semester the users wants to move to.

==== Current Implementation

When a user execute the `planner_move` command (e.g. `planner_move year/1 sem/2 code/CS1010`), the following steps
are taken by the application.

Given below is a sequence diagram for moving a module that illustrates the interactions among `PlannerMoveCommand`,
`PlannerMoveCommandParser` and `Model`:

.PlannerMove component interactions
image::PlannerMoveComponentSequenceDiagram.png[width="650"]

Step 1. The `PlannerMoveCommandParser#parse` method is invoked. The `PlannerMoveCommandParser` receives the command with
the arguments as a string.

Step 2. The `PlannerMoveCommandParser` parses the text related to each `PREFIX` and constructs the `PlannerMoveCommand`
. If more than one of each kind of `PREFIX` (e.g. `year/1 sem/2 code/CS1231 code/CS1010`) is provided, only text related
to last of each `PREFIX` (e.g. `year/1 sem/2 code/CS1010`) will be parsed.

[NOTE]
====
* The input should consist of the year and the semester of the degree plan that the user wants to move to and the module
code that the user want to move.
* `PlannerMoveCommandParser` will throw an error if the user input does not match the command format.
====

Step 3. The `PlannerMoveCommand` with `YEAR`, `SEMESTER` and `CODE` specified by the user is returned.

Step 4. The `PlannerMoveCommand#execute` method is invoked.

Given below is a sequence diagram that illustrates the interactions among `PlannerMoveCommand`, `Model` and
`Application`:

.PlannerMoveCommand in detail interactions
image::PlannerMoveCommandSequenceDiagramDetail.png[width="650"]

During this step, the following methods are carried out in the order:

* The `getDegreePlannerByCode` method will be called to check if there exists any academic semester in degree plan that
has the parsed module code.

* The `getApplication` method will be called followed by the `getDegreePlannerList` method will be called by the
model to retrieve the list of academic semesters available in the degree plan. Then, `filter` will be carried out
with the help of `DegreePlanner#isSameDegreePlanner` to locate the academic semester the user wants to move the
module to.

[NOTE]
====
`null` will be returned instead of `DegreePlanner` object if no academic semester matching the year and the semester is
found.
====

* The `getModuleByCode` method will be called to return `Module` object having the code `toMove`. Then, the `Module`
object will be used to retrieve the semesters the module is available in with the `getSemesters` method to check if the
module is offered in the academic semester the user is trying to move to.

* The `getModuleByCode` method will be called in a loop during the `filter` to find out all the module's co-requisites
not offered in the academic semester the user is trying to move to.

[NOTE]
====
Any violations in the checks will result in throwing of an error message.
====

Step 5. The `Model` is updated.

[NOTE]
====
* If any of the above check fails, `Model` will not be updated since there is nothing to be
changed.

* If all the above checks passes, the `PlannerMoveCommand` class will update the context in `ModelManager` by calling
 the`moveModuleBetweenPlanner` method which will call `setDegreePlanner` method.

* After updating the `Model` The `PlannerMoveCommand` will save the current database state through `commitApplication`
(for undo/redo functions).
====

Step 6. A `CommandResult` object is returned.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How should searching of the degree plan based on the year and the semester provided to be done

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Construct `DegreePlanner` object with the year and the semester provided and use
`DegreePlanner#isSameDegreePlanner` to compare and search for the corresponding degree plan.

[cols="30%,<70%"]
|======
|*Pros*| There is no need to create any method that may create unnecessary coupling.
|*Cons*| There is a need to create a `DegreePlanner` object in order to use `DegreePlanner#isSameDegreePlanner`.
|======

* **Alternative 2:** Create `getDegreePlanner` method which retrieves `DegreePlanner` object based on the year and
the semester provided.

[cols="30%,<70%"]
|======
|*Pros*| Easy to implement.
|*Cons*| The method will create unnecessary couplings between `Application` and `Year` as well as between `Application`
 and `Semester`.
|======
// end::planner-move[]

// tag::planner-show[]
=== Planner Show Feature

Planner show feature aims to help users to be able to easily locate and display any academic semesters in the degree
plan which is in our application. We support the displaying of degree planners based on year, semester and boolean
expressions. This enables our users to display only specific academic semesters in the degree plan that they want.

==== Overview

When a user invokes the `planner_show` command. (e.g. `planner_show y/YEAR && s/SEMESTER`), the following steps
are taken by the program.

1. Extract the text related to `planner_show` command (e.g. `y/YEAR && s/SEMESTER`)
2. Parse the text related to each `PREFIX` individually.
3. Return a composite predicate for all attributes.

Step 1 is performed by the `ApplicationParser` class.

Step 2 and 3 are performed by `BooleanExpressionParser#parse`.

==== Current Implementation

* Show degree planner(s) by year
i.e. `planner_show y/YEAR`
returns degree planner(s) having its year matches the year given

* Show degree planner(s) by semester
i.e. `planner_show s/SEMESTER`
returns degree planner(s) having its semester matches the semester given

* include `year` and `semester` attributes in one `planner_show` command and list degree planner(s)
i.e. `planner_show y/YEAR s/SEMESTER`
returns module having its year or semester matches the given year and semester

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How to parse multiple attributes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Parse the text related to each `PREFIX` individually using `BooleanExpressionParser`

[cols="30%,<70%"]
|======
|*Pros*|User is able to have more flexible search.
|*Cons*|More time and work needed for developer to implement.
|======

* **Alternative 2:** Parse the text related to each `PREFIX` at one go without using `BooleanExpressionParser`

[cols="30%,<70%"]
|======
|*Pros*|Easy to implement.
|*Cons*|Additional overhead needed and inconsistent in the application's commands since `find` utilises `BooleanExpressionParser`.
|======
// end::planner-show[]

// tag::planner-suggest[]
=== Planner Suggest Feature
The `planner_suggest` command in PWE is used to suggest module code(s) to add to the degree plan.

==== Current implementation

The `planner_suggest` command requires the `PlannerSuggestCommandParser` class to parse the user input provided. The
 parsed data will then be passed to the `PlannerSuggestCommand` class.

The input should contain the desirable credits. Another optional input is the desirable tags.

`PlannerSuggestCommandParser` will throw an error if the user input does not match the command format.

After passing the above check, `PlannerSuggestCommand` will make the result box display 3 lists of modules. The first list
is the main recommendation list that sorts the modules in a specific way and displays maximum 10 most recommended modules.
The second and the third list respectively displays the modules with matching tags and modules with matching credits. The
modules in the two lists should also exist in the main recommendation list.

If `tag` is supplied as a parameter in input, modules will be sorted according to tags first. Modules with greater number
of tags that match the desirable tags will be prioritized. If tie, modules with credits closer to the desirable credits
will be prioritized. If tie again, modules will be sorted according to alphabetical order.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Choice of where to put `ModuleToSuggest` class.

- Alternative 1 (current choice): Put `ModuleToSuggest` as inner class of `PlannerSuggestCommand` class.

[cols="30%,<70%"]
|======
|*Pros*| Cleaner model for the Application.
|*Cons*| The inner class has access to the private and protected members of the outer class, which can be unnecessary.
|======

- Alternative 2: Put `ModuleToSuggest` as a separate class apart from `PlannerSuggestCommand` class.

[cols="30%,<70%"]
|=====
|*Pros*| Better encapsulation for `PlannerSuggestCommand` class.
|*Cons*| As no other class needs to access the `ModuleToSuggest` class, making it a separate class is unnecessary and makes the model more complex.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.
|_not set_

|`site-githuburl`
|URL to the site's repository on https://github.com[GitHub].
Setting this will add a "View on GitHub" link in the navigation bar.
|_not set_

|`site-seedu`
|Define this attribute if the project is an official SE-EDU project.
This will render the SE-EDU navigation bar at the top of the page, and add some SE-EDU-specific navigation items.
|_not set_

|===

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-section`
|Site section that the document belongs to.
This will cause the associated item in the navigation bar to be highlighted.
One of: `UserGuide`, `DeveloperGuide`, ``LearningOutcomes``{asterisk}, `AboutUs`, `ContactUs`

_{asterisk} Official SE-EDU projects only_
|_not set_

|`no-site-header`
|Set this attribute to remove the site navigation bar.
|_not set_

|===

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `pwe.planner.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `pwe.planner.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `pwe.planner.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `pwe.planner.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

**Problem: Keyboard and mouse movements are not simulated on macOS Mojave, resulting in GUI Tests failure.**

* Reason: From macOS Mojave onwards, applications without `Accessibility` permission cannot simulate certain keyboard and mouse movements.
* Solution: Open `System Preferences`, click `Security and Privacy` -> `Privacy` -> `Accessibility`, and check the box beside `Intellij IDEA`.

.`Accessibility` permission is granted to `IntelliJ IDEA`
image::testfx-idea-accessibility-permissions.png[width="600"]

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/pwe/planner/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, PlanWithEase depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[appendix]
== Instructions for Manual Testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.

=== Launch and Shutdown

. Initial launch

.. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder
.. Double-click the jar file +
   Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.
